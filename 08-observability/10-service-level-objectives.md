## Introduction

Service Level Objectives (SLOs) represent the bridge between technical operations and business outcomes. They define the target level of reliability that a service should provide to its users, creating a shared language between engineering teams, product managers, and business stakeholders.

### Why SLOs Matter

**Customer-Centric Reliability**: SLOs shift focus from internal metrics (like "five nines uptime") to user-experienced reliability. A service can have 99.9% uptime but still deliver a poor user experience if requests are slow or return errors.

**Risk Management**: SLOs provide a framework for making informed trade-offs between reliability investments and feature development. They answer the critical question: "How much reliability is enough?"

**Decision Framework**: When engineers must choose between fixing a bug, building a new feature, or improving infrastructure, SLOs provide objective criteria for prioritization.

**Organizational Alignment**: SLOs create shared accountability and understanding across teams, reducing conflicts between "move fast" and "don't break things" philosophies.

## Core Concepts and Definitions

### Service Level Indicator (SLI)

**Definition**: A carefully chosen quantitative measure of a service's behavior, expressed as a ratio of good events to total events.

**Mathematical Form**:
```
SLI = (Good Events / Total Events) × 100%
```

**Characteristics**:
- **Measurable**: Can be objectively calculated from data
- **User-Centric**: Reflects actual user experience
- **Actionable**: Clear when service is meeting/missing targets
- **Proportional**: Linear relationship with user satisfaction

**Example SLIs**:
- Request Success Rate: `successful_requests / total_requests`
- Request Latency: `requests_under_threshold / total_requests`
- Data Freshness: `fresh_data_reads / total_reads`
- Throughput: `completed_operations / requested_operations`

### Service Level Objective (SLO)

**Definition**: A target value or range for an SLI over a specific time window.

**Structure**: `SLI ≥ Target % over Time Window`

**Example SLOs**:
- 99.9% of requests succeed over a rolling 28-day window
- 95% of requests complete in < 200ms over the last 7 days
- 99.5% of data reads return fresh data (< 5 minutes old) per day

**Key Properties**:
- **Specific**: Clearly defined threshold
- **Measurable**: Based on quantifiable SLI
- **Time-Bound**: Explicit measurement window
- **Achievable**: Realistic given system constraints
- **User-Meaningful**: Correlates with user satisfaction

### Service Level Agreement (SLA)

**Definition**: A contractual agreement between service provider and customer that includes consequences (usually financial) for missing service level targets.

**Relationship to SLO**:
```
SLA Target < SLO Target < Internal Target
```

**Example**: 
- SLA: 99.5% availability (customer gets refund if missed)
- SLO: 99.9% availability (internal goal with error budget)
- Internal Target: 99.95% (engineering aspiration with buffer)

    D -->|Yes| E[Good - Monitor Closely]
    D -->|No| F{Meets SLA?<br/>99.5%}
    
    F -->|Yes| G[Warning - Freeze Features<br/>Focus on Reliability]
    F -->|No| H[Critical - Customer Impact<br/>Financial Penalties]
    
    style C fill:#2ecc71
    style E fill:#3498db
    style G fill:#f39c12
    style H fill:#e74c3c
```

### Error Budget

**Definition**: The maximum amount of unreliability permitted by an SLO, expressed as the complement of the target.

**Calculation**:
```
Error Budget = 100% - SLO Target
```

**Example**:
- SLO: 99.9% success rate
- Error Budget: 0.1% (100% - 99.9%)
- Over 30 days: ~43 minutes of downtime allowed

**Philosophy**: Error budgets transform reliability from a binary "always up" requirement into a quantifiable resource that can be:
- **Spent** on risky deployments, experiments, or maintenance
- **Saved** by conservative operations
- **Invested** in reliability improvements
- **Monitored** to inform decision-making

## The SLO Framework

### Google's SRE Approach

The Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) model pioneered by Google provides the foundational framework for modern SLO practice.

**Core Principles**:

1. **100% is the Wrong Target**: Perfect reliability is impossible and, more importantly, undesirable. Users cannot distinguish between 99.99% and 100% availability, but the engineering cost difference is enormous.

2. **Error Budgets Enable Innovation**: By accepting that some failure is acceptable, teams can move faster and take calculated risks.

3. **SLOs Drive Prioritization**: When error budget is healthy, build features. When exhausted, improve reliability. Clear, objective decision-making.

4. **Measure What Users Care About**: Internal metrics like CPU usage matter only insofar as they affect user-visible behavior.

## Service Level Indicators (SLIs)

### Types of SLIs

#### 1. Request/Response SLIs

**Availability SLI**:
```
Availability = successful_requests / total_requests
```

**What counts as "successful"**:
- HTTP 2xx, 3xx status codes (not 4xx, 5xx)
- Completed within timeout
- Returned valid data
- No internal errors

**Latency SLI**:
```
Latency = requests_under_threshold / total_requests
```

**Threshold Selection**:
- Based on user perception thresholds
- Different thresholds for different operations
- Example: 200ms for API calls, 2s for page loads

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Request] --> B[Measure]
    B --> C{Success?}
    B --> D{Under Threshold?}
    
    C -->|Yes| E[Good Event - Availability]
    C -->|No| F[Bad Event - Availability]
    
    D -->|Yes| G[Good Event - Latency]
    D -->|No| H[Bad Event - Latency]
    
    E --> I[Count in Numerator]
    F --> J[Count in Denominator Only]
    G --> I
    H --> J
    
    I --> K[Calculate SLI]
    J --> K
    
    style E fill:#2ecc71
    style F fill:#e74c3c
    style G fill:#2ecc71
    style H fill:#e74c3c
```

#### 2. Data Processing SLIs

**Freshness SLI**:
```
Freshness = records_processed_on_time / total_records
```

**Use Cases**:
- Batch processing pipelines
- Data analytics systems
- Cache update processes
- Search index updates

**Throughput SLI**:
```
Throughput = actual_processing_rate / expected_processing_rate
```

**Correctness SLI**:
```
Correctness = correct_output_records / total_output_records
```

#### 3. Storage SLIs

**Durability SLI**:
```
Durability = (total_writes - data_loss_events) / total_writes
```

**Read Availability**:
```
Read_Availability = successful_reads / total_read_requests
```

**Write Availability**:
```
Write_Availability = successful_writes / total_write_requests
```

### SLI Specification Template

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[SLI Specification] --> B[Name and Description]
    A --> C[Implementation]
    A --> D[Measurement]
    
    B --> B1[Clear, descriptive name]
    B --> B2[User-facing behavior described]
    B --> B3[Why this matters to users]
    
    C --> C1[Numerator: Good events definition]
    C --> C2[Denominator: Total events definition]

    D --> D1[Measurement frequency]
    D --> D2[Measurement window]
    D --> D3[Aggregation method]
    
    style A fill:#3498db
```

**Example Specification**:

**Name**: API Request Availability  
**Description**: The proportion of API requests that complete successfully without server errors  
**User Impact**: Failed requests prevent users from accessing their data  

**Numerator**: Count of HTTP requests with status code 2xx or 3xx  
**Denominator**: Count of all HTTP requests received  
**Data Source**: Application metrics (see [03-metrics.md](03-metrics.md))  
**Query**: `sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"2..|3.."}[5m])) / sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m]))`

**Measurement Frequency**: Every 5 minutes  
**Measurement Window**: Rolling 28 days  
**Aggregation**: Time-weighted average

## Defining Effective SLOs

### Setting Initial Targets

#### The Baseline Approach

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Collect Historical Data] --> B[Analyze Distribution]
    B --> C[Identify Current Performance]
    
    C --> D[Current p50: 99.8%]
    C --> E[Current p10: 99.2%]
    C --> F[Current p1: 98.5%]
    
    D --> G[Conservative Initial SLO]
    E --> G
    F --> G
    
    G --> H[Set Target: 99.0%]
    H --> I[Above worst case]
    H --> J[Below typical case]
    H --> K[Room to improve]
    
    style G fill:#3498db
    style H fill:#f39c12
```

**Process**:
1. Measure current performance for 2-4 weeks
2. Calculate percentiles (p50, p90, p99)
3. Set initial SLO between p10 and p50
4. Provides buffer for variability
5. Iterate based on learning

#### The User Research Approach

**Steps**:
1. Conduct user satisfaction surveys
2. Correlate satisfaction with service metrics
3. Identify inflection points where satisfaction drops
4. Set SLO at these thresholds

**Example Finding**:
- Users satisfied when latency < 200ms: 95% happy
- Latency 200-400ms: 75% happy
- Latency > 400ms: 30% happy
- **Conclusion**: Set SLO at 95% of requests < 200ms

#### The Competitive Analysis Approach

Research industry standards and competitor SLAs:
- AWS S3: 99.9% availability SLA
- Google Cloud Storage: 99.95% availability SLA
- Azure Storage: 99.9% availability SLA

Set internal SLO above industry SLA standards to maintain competitive advantage.

    style F fill:#2ecc71
```

### Time Windows

**Short Windows (1-7 days)**:
- **Pros**: Fast feedback, quick detection of issues
- **Cons**: Sensitive to short outages, may trigger false urgency
- **Best For**: User-facing services, rapid iteration environments

**Medium Windows (28-30 days)**:
- **Pros**: Balanced sensitivity, standard monthly reporting
- **Cons**: Slower feedback on degradation
- **Best For**: Production services, SLA alignment

**Long Windows (90 days)**:
- **Pros**: Smooths short-term variance, strategic view
- **Cons**: Very slow feedback, masks recent problems
- **Best For**: Infrastructure services, capacity planning

**Rolling vs Calendar Windows**:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Window Types] --> B[Rolling Window]
    A --> C[Calendar Window]
    
    B --> B1[Continuous evaluation]
    B --> B2[Always includes recent data]
    B --> B3[Example: Last 30 days]
    B --> B4[Pro: Immediate feedback]
    B --> B5[Con: Complex to reason about]
    
    C --> C1[Fixed boundaries]
    C --> C2[Resets periodically]

    C --> C5[Con: Can game the system]
    
    style B fill:#3498db
    style C fill:#9b59b6
```

### Multiple SLOs for One Service

**Why Multiple SLOs**:
- Different aspects of reliability (availability, latency, correctness)
- Different user journeys (read path, write path, search)
- Different critical levels (critical, important, nice-to-have)

**Example: E-commerce Service**:

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[E-commerce Service] --> B[Critical SLOs]
    A --> C[Important SLOs]
    A --> D[Aspirational SLOs]
    
    B --> B1[Checkout Availability: 99.95%]
    B --> B2[Payment Processing: 99.99%]
    B --> B3[Order Placement Latency: 99% < 1s]
    
    C --> C1[Browse Availability: 99.9%]
    C --> C2[Search Latency: 95% < 500ms]
    C --> C3[Product Page Load: 90% < 2s]
    
    D --> D1[Recommendation Quality: 80% relevance]
    D --> D2[Search Freshness: 95% < 5min old]
    
    style B fill:#e74c3c
    style C fill:#f39c12
    style D fill:#3498db
```

## Error Budgets

### Error Budget Calculation

**For Availability SLO**:

```
Monthly Error Budget = (1 - SLO) × Time Period
```

**Example (99.9% SLO over 30 days)**:
```
Error Budget = (1 - 0.999) × 30 days
            = 0.001 × 43,200 minutes
            = 43.2 minutes of downtime allowed
```

**For Request-Based SLO (1M requests/day)**:
```
Daily Error Budget = 1,000,000 × (1 - 0.999)
                   = 1,000 failed requests allowed
```

### Error Budget Consumption

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Error Budget Consumption Sources] --> B[Planned Events]
    A --> C[Unplanned Events]
    
    B --> B1[Deployments]
    B --> B2[Maintenance Windows]

    style H fill:#2ecc71
    style I fill:#f39c12
    style J fill:#e74c3c
```

### Burn Rate

**Definition**: The rate at which error budget is being consumed, expressed as a multiple of the acceptable rate.

**Calculation**:
```
Burn Rate = (Actual Error Rate) / (SLO Error Rate)
```

**Example**:
- SLO: 99.9% (0.1% error budget)
- Current Error Rate: 1% (10× the budget)
- Burn Rate: 10×

**Interpretation**:
- Burn Rate = 1: Consuming budget at exactly the right pace
- Burn Rate < 1: Under budget, room for risk-taking
- Burn Rate > 1: Over budget, reliability work needed

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Burn Rate Analysis] --> B{Burn Rate Value?}
    
    B -->|< 1| C[Under Budget]
    B -->|= 1| D[On Track]

```

### Error Budget Policies

Explicit rules for how teams respond to error budget status:

**Example Policy**:

| Error Budget Remaining | Action Required |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| > 75% | Normal velocity, take risks, experiment |
| 50-75% | Normal velocity, standard testing |
| 25-50% | Reduce deployment frequency, increase testing |
| 10-25% | Feature freeze, reliability work only, executive approval for deploys |
| < 10% | Complete feature freeze, 24/7 on-call, mandatory postmortems |

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Error Budget Status] --> B{Percentage Remaining?}
    
    B -->|> 75%| C[Zone: Innovation]
    B -->|50-75%| D[Zone: Normal Operations]
    B -->|25-50%| E[Zone: Caution]

### SLI Implementation Patterns

#### Client-Side Measurement

**Advantages**:
- True user experience
- Includes network latency
- Captures client-side errors

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires client instrumentation
- Sampling bias (only successful connections)
- Privacy considerations

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Browser] --> B[Make Request]
    B --> C[Record Start Time]
    C --> D[Receive Response]
    D --> E[Record End Time]
    E --> F[Calculate Latency]
    F --> G{Success?}
    
    G -->|Yes| H[Send Success Beacon]
    G -->|No| I[Send Failure Beacon]
    
    H --> J[Analytics Service]
    I --> J
    
    J --> K[Aggregate SLI Data]
    
    style A fill:#3498db
    style J fill:#2ecc71
```

#### Server-Side Measurement

**Advantages**:
- Complete visibility
- No sampling bias
- Easier to implement

**Disadvantages**:
- Doesn't capture network issues
- Misses client-side failures
- May not reflect user experience

### Configuration Management

**SLO as Code Example** (YAML):

```yaml
slos:
  - name: api-availability
    description: API requests succeed without server errors
    service: user-api
    sli:
      type: availability
      numerator: http_requests_total{status=~"2..|3.."}
      denominator: http_requests_total
      data_source: prometheus
    objective:
      target: 99.9
      window: 28d
    error_budget_policy:
      - threshold: 75%
        action: normal_operations
      - threshold: 50%
        action: increase_caution
      - threshold: 25%
        action: feature_freeze
  
  - name: api-latency
    description: API requests complete within 200ms
    service: user-api
    sli:
      type: latency
      threshold_ms: 200
      numerator: http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.2"}
      denominator: http_request_duration_seconds_count
      data_source: prometheus
    objective:
      target: 95.0
      window: 28d
```

## Measuring and Monitoring SLOs

### SLI Query Patterns

#### Prometheus Examples

**Availability SLI**:
```promql
sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"2..|3.."}[5m]))
/
sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m]))
```

**Latency SLI (using histogram)**:
```promql
histogram_quantile(0.95, 
  sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le)
) < 0.2
```

**Latency SLI (using buckets)**:
```promql
sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.2"}[5m]))
/
sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_count[5m]))
```

#### Error Budget Remaining

```promql
1 - (
  (1 - avg_over_time(sli_availability[28d]))
  /
  (1 - slo_target)
)
```

### Compliance Tracking

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[28-Day Window] --> B[Divide into 1-hour buckets]
    B --> C[Calculate SLI per bucket]
    C --> D[Count good buckets]
    D --> E[Calculate Compliance]
    
    E --> F{Meets SLO?}

    F -->|No| H[SLO Missed: 99.7%]
    
    G --> I[Error Budget Remaining]
    H --> J[Error Budget Exhausted By]
    
    I --> K[Can Deploy Features]
    J --> L[Must Improve Reliability]
    
    style G fill:#2ecc71
    style H fill:#e74c3c
```

## SLO-Driven Alerting

### Traditional vs SLO-Based Alerting

**Traditional Alerting Problems**:
- Alert on symptoms, not user impact
- Too many false positives (alert fatigue)
- Threshold-based, not context-aware
- No connection to business objectives

**SLO-Based Alerting Benefits**:
- Alerts tied directly to user experience
- Reduced false positives
- Clear prioritization
- Actionable with business context

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Traditional Alerting"
        A1[CPU > 80%] --> A2[Page Oncall]
        A3[Memory > 90%] --> A2
        A4[Disk > 85%] --> A2
        
        A2 --> A5{User Impact?}
        A5 -->|Unknown| A6[Investigate Anyway]
    end

        B5 -->|Yes| B6[Page Oncall]
        B5 -->|No| B7[Ticket for Later]
        
        B6 --> B8[Known User Impact]
    end
    
    style A2 fill:#e74c3c
    style A6 fill:#f39c12
    style B6 fill:#e74c3c
    style B8 fill:#2ecc71
```

### Alerting on Burn Rate

**Single Window Alert** (Simple but Flawed):
```
Alert: IF burn_rate > threshold FOR duration
```

**Problem**: Cannot distinguish between:
- Short, severe outage (needs immediate attention)
- Long, slow degradation (needs investigation)

### Multi-Window Strategy

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Monitor Error Budget] --> B[Short Window: 1 hour]
    A --> C[Long Window: 6 hours]
    
    B --> D{Burn Rate > 14.4?}
    C --> E{Burn Rate > 6?}
    
    D -->|Yes| F[Fast Burn Detected]
    E -->|Yes| G[Sustained Burn Detected]
    
    F --> H{Both Windows Burning?}
    G --> H
    
    H -->|Yes| I[High Severity Alert<br/>Page Immediately]
    H -->|No| J[Monitor - May Self-Resolve]
    
    I --> K[Will exhaust budget in 2 days]
    
    style I fill:#e74c3c
    style K fill:#ff9800
```

**Rationale**:
- **Short Window**: Catches sudden, severe issues
- **Long Window**: Confirms sustained problem
- **Both Required**: Reduces false positives

## Multi-Window Multi-Burn-Rate Alerts

### The Google SRE Model

**Four Alert Tiers** based on urgency and budget consumption:

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Alert Tiers] --> B[Tier 1: Critical<br/>Page Immediately]
    A --> C[Tier 2: High<br/>Page Business Hours]
    A --> D[Tier 3: Medium<br/>Ticket]
    A --> E[Tier 4: Low<br/>Log Only]
    
    B --> B1[1h window: 14.4x burn]
    B --> B2[6h window: 6x burn]
    B --> B3[Budget exhausted in: 2 days]
    
    C --> C1[6h window: 6x burn]
    C --> C2[24h window: 3x burn]
    C --> C3[Budget exhausted in: 5 days]
    
    D --> D1[24h window: 3x burn]
    D --> D2[3d window: 1x burn]
    D --> D3[Budget exhausted in: 10 days]
    
    E --> E1[3d window: 1x burn]
    E --> E2[Information only]
    
    style B fill:#e74c3c
    style C fill:#ff9800
    style D fill:#f39c12
    style E fill:#3498db
```

### Burn Rate Calculation

**For 28-day SLO Window**:

```
Budget Consumption Rate = (Current Error Rate) / (SLO Error Rate)

Acceptable Burn Rate = 1.0 (consume budget evenly over 28 days)

Critical Burn Rate = 14.4
- Means: Will exhaust budget in 28/14.4 ≈ 2 days
- Action: Immediate page

High Burn Rate = 6.0
- Means: Will exhaust budget in 28/6 ≈ 5 days
- Action: Page during business hours

Medium Burn Rate = 3.0
- Means: Will exhaust budget in 28/3 ≈ 9 days
- Action: Create ticket
```

### Alert Configuration Example

**Tier 1: Critical (Page Immediately)**:
```yaml
alert: SLOBurnRateCritical
expr: |
  (
    (1 - (sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"2..|3.."}[1h])) / 
          sum(rate(http_requests_total[1h])))) > 14.4 * (1 - 0.999)
  )
  and
  (
    (1 - (sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"2..|3.."}[6h])) / 
          sum(rate(http_requests_total[6h])))) > 6 * (1 - 0.999)
  )
for: 5m
severity: critical
message: "Critical burn rate detected. Error budget will exhaust in 2 days."
```

**Tier 2: High (Page Business Hours)**:
```yaml
alert: SLOBurnRateHigh
expr: |
  (
    (1 - (sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"2..|3.."}[6h])) / 
          sum(rate(http_requests_total[6h])))) > 6 * (1 - 0.999)
  )
  and
  (
    (1 - (sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"2..|3.."}[24h])) / 
          sum(rate(http_requests_total[24h])))) > 3 * (1 - 0.999)
  )
for: 15m
severity: warning
message: "High burn rate detected. Error budget will exhaust in 5 days."
```

### Reset and Recovery

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Incident Occurs] --> B[Burn Rate Spikes]
    B --> C[Alert Fires]
    C --> D[Team Responds]
    
    D --> E[Issue Resolved]
    E --> F[Error Rate Returns to Normal]
    
    F --> G{Short Window Recovered?}
    G -->|Yes| H[Alert Pending]
    
    H --> I{Long Window Recovered?}
    I -->|Yes| J[Alert Resolves]
    I -->|No| K[Continue Monitoring]
    
    K --> L[Wait for Long Window]
    L --> I
    
    style C fill:#e74c3c
    style J fill:#2ecc71
```

**Reset Time Considerations**:
- Short windows reset quickly (good for rapid feedback)
- Long windows take time (prevents premature "all clear")
- Both must recover for alert to clear

## Error Budget Policies

### Policy Framework

**Purpose**: Define clear, agreed-upon actions based on error budget status.

**Key Stakeholders**:
- Engineering (implements policy)
- Product (affected by feature freeze)
- SRE (enforces policy)
- Leadership (approves exceptions)

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Error Budget Policy] --> B[Measurement]
    A --> C[Thresholds]
    A --> D[Actions]
    A --> E[Exceptions]
    A --> F[Review Process]
    
    B --> B1[How is budget calculated?]
    B --> B2[What time window?]
    B --> B3[How often evaluated?]
    
    C --> C1[Normal operations: > 50%]
    C --> C2[Caution: 25-50%]
    C --> C3[Restricted: 10-25%]
    C --> C4[Emergency: < 10%]
    
    D --> D1[Normal: Standard velocity]
    D --> D2[Caution: Slow down deploys]
    D --> D3[Restricted: Feature freeze]
    D --> D4[Emergency: All-hands reliability]
    
    E --> E1[Who can approve?]
    E --> E2[What justification required?]
    E --> E3[How is exception tracked?]
    
    F --> F1[When to review policy?]
    F --> F2[How to update thresholds?]
    
    style A fill:#3498db
    style D fill:#f39c12
```

### Sample Error Budget Policy

**Service: User Authentication API**  
**SLO: 99.9% availability over 28 days**  
**Error Budget: 43.2 minutes per month**

| Budget Remaining | Development Velocity | Deployment Frequency | Required Approvals | On-Call Level |
|------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| 75-100% | Normal | Up to 5/day | Engineering Lead | Standard rotation |
| 50-75% | Normal | Up to 3/day | Engineering Lead | Standard rotation |
| 25-50% | Reduced | Up to 1/day | Engineering Lead + SRE | Enhanced on-call |
| 10-25% | Minimal | Only critical fixes | Director + VP Engineering | 24/7 coverage |
| 0-10% | Zero | Complete freeze | VP Engineering only | All-hands war room |

**Automatic Actions**:
- Budget < 25%: Automated notification to leadership
- Budget < 10%: Automated CI/CD pipeline restriction
- Budget exhausted: Automated deploy block (manual override required)

### Policy Enforcement Mechanisms

- Critical security patches
- Data loss prevention
- Regulatory compliance
- Revenue-impacting bugs

**Exception Request Template**:
```markdown
## Error Budget Exception Request

**Service**: [Service Name]
**Current Error Budget**: [X%] remaining
**Requested Action**: [Deploy/Change Description]
**Urgency**: [Critical/High/Medium]

**Business Justification**:
[Explain why this cannot wait for budget recovery]

**Risk Assessment**:

- Rollback plan: [Description]
- Mitigation measures: [List]

**Approval Required From**:
- [ ] Engineering Manager
- [ ] SRE Lead
- [ ] Director of Engineering (if < 25% budget)
- [ ] VP Engineering (if < 10% budget)

**Tracking**:
- Exception granted: [Yes/No]
- Actual impact: [Measured post-deploy]
- Postmortem required: [Yes/No]
```

## SLOs for Different Service Types

### User-Facing Services

**Characteristics**:
- Direct user interaction
- Synchronous request/response
- Latency-sensitive

**Recommended SLIs**:
1. **Availability**: Request success rate
2. **Latency**: Request completion time (p95, p99)
3. **Correctness**: Proper response content

**Example SLOs**:
```yaml
service: web-frontend
slos:
  - name: availability
    target: 99.9%
    window: 28d
    
  - name: latency-p95
    target: 95%  # 95% of requests under 200ms
    threshold: 200ms
    window: 28d
    
  - name: latency-p99
    target: 99%  # 99% of requests under 1000ms
    threshold: 1000ms
    window: 28d
```

### Background Processing Services

**Characteristics**:
- Asynchronous processing
- Batch operations
- Throughput-focused

**Recommended SLIs**:
1. **Throughput**: Items processed per time unit
2. **Freshness**: Time from creation to processing
3. **Completeness**: Percentage of items processed

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Data Pipeline SLIs] --> B[Freshness]
    A --> C[Throughput]
    A --> D[Correctness]
    
    B --> B1[95% processed within 5 minutes]
    C --> C1[10,000 items/second minimum]
    D --> D1[99.9% data validation passed]
    
    style A fill:#9b59b6
```

**Example SLOs**:
```yaml
service: email-processor
slos:
  - name: freshness
    target: 95%
    threshold: 300s  # 5 minutes
    window: 24h
    description: "95% of emails processed within 5 minutes of arrival"
    
  - name: throughput
    target: 99%
    threshold: 1000  # emails per minute
    window: 7d
    description: "Maintain minimum 1000 emails/min throughput 99% of the time"
```

### Data Storage Services

**Characteristics**:
- Read and write operations
- Different SLOs for reads vs writes
- Durability critical

**Recommended SLIs**:
1. **Read Availability**
2. **Write Availability**
3. **Read Latency**
4. **Write Latency**
5. **Durability**

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Storage Service SLOs] --> B[Read Path]
    A --> C[Write Path]
    A --> D[Data Integrity]
    
    B --> B1[Availability: 99.99%]
    B --> B2[Latency p99: < 100ms]
    
    C --> C1[Availability: 99.9%]
    C --> C2[Latency p99: < 500ms]
    C --> C3[Durability: 99.999999999%]
    
    D --> D1[Correctness: 100%]
    D --> D2[Consistency checks pass]
    
    style A fill:#3498db
    style C3 fill:#e74c3c
```

### API Services

**Characteristics**:
- Third-party integrations
- Rate limiting
- Multiple client types

**Recommended SLIs**:
1. **Availability** (per endpoint)
2. **Latency** (per endpoint)
3. **Rate Limit Success**

**Example with Multi-Class SLOs**:
```yaml
service: public-api
slos:
  # Critical endpoints - stricter SLO
  - name: auth-availability
    target: 99.95%
    endpoints: ["/auth/login", "/auth/token"]
    window: 28d
    
  # Standard endpoints
  - name: data-availability
    target: 99.9%
    endpoints: ["/users/*", "/products/*"]
    window: 28d
    
  # Best-effort endpoints
  - name: analytics-availability
    target: 99%
    endpoints: ["/analytics/*", "/reports/*"]
    window: 28d
```

### Mobile Backend Services

**Characteristics**:
- Intermittent connectivity
- Background sync
- Push notifications

**Recommended SLIs**:
1. **API Availability**
2. **API Latency** (considering mobile networks)
3. **Push Notification Delivery**
4. **Sync Success Rate**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Mobile Backend SLOs] --> B[Online Operations]
    A --> C[Offline-First Features]
    A --> D[Push Notifications]
    
    B --> B1[API availability: 99.9%]
    B --> B2[Latency p95 < 1s on 3G]
    
    C --> C1[Sync success: 99%]
    C --> C2[Conflict resolution: 99.9%]
    
    D --> D1[Delivery rate: 98%]
    D --> D2[Delivery latency < 30s: 95%]
    
    style A fill:#3498db
```

## Common Pitfalls and Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: The Vanity SLO

**Problem**: Setting SLOs that look impressive but don't reflect user experience.

**Example**: "99.99% uptime" when users actually care about request success rate.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Server Uptime: 99.99%] --> B[Looks Great!]
    B --> C[But...]
    C --> D[50% of requests failing]
    C --> E[Latency 10 seconds]
    C --> F[Wrong data returned]
    
    D --> G[Users Unhappy]
    E --> G
    F --> G
    
    style A fill:#2ecc71
    style G fill:#e74c3c
```

**Solution**: Measure what users experience, not what makes metrics look good.

### Anti-Pattern 2: Too Many SLOs

**Problem**: Creating SLOs for every possible metric.

**Symptoms**:
- 20+ SLOs per service
- Constant error budget exhaustion
- Alert fatigue
- Unable to prioritize

**Solution**: 
- Start with 2-3 critical SLOs
- Focus on user-impacting metrics
- Consolidate related SLOs

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Too Many SLOs] --> B[Developer Confusion]
    A --> C[Split Focus]
    A --> D[Alert Fatigue]
    
    B --> E[Which SLO matters most?]
    C --> F[Can't improve everything]
    D --> G[Ignore all alerts]
    
    E --> H[Bad Outcome]
    F --> H
    G --> H
    
    style A fill:#e74c3c
    style H fill:#95a5a6
```

### Anti-Pattern 3: The "Perfect" SLO

**Problem**: Setting 100% or 99.999% targets without justification.

**Why It Fails**:
- Mathematically impossible to achieve
- No error budget for safe deployment
- Expensive to maintain
- Users can't perceive the difference

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[100% SLO Target] --> B[No Error Budget]
    B --> C[Cannot Deploy Safely]
    C --> D[Innovation Halts]
    
    A --> E[Extremely Expensive]

    H --> I[Metric Becomes Meaningless]
    
    style A fill:#e74c3c
    style D fill:#95a5a6
```

**Solution**: Set targets based on:
- User perception thresholds
- Current capability + improvement room
- Cost/benefit analysis
- Industry standards

### Anti-Pattern 4: The Unmeasurable SLO

**Problem**: Defining SLOs without ability to measure them accurately.

**Examples**:
- "System should be fast" (no definition of "fast")
- "Data should be correct" (no validation mechanism)
- "Users should be satisfied" (no satisfaction metric)

**Solution**: Only create SLOs with:
- Clear measurement methodology
- Instrumentation in place
- Automated calculation
- Real-time visibility

### Anti-Pattern 5: Ignoring Error Budget Policies

**Problem**: Having SLOs but not enforcing actions when budget exhausted.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Error Budget Exhausted] --> B{Policy Enforced?}
    
    B -->|No| C[Continue Normal Ops]
    C --> D[SLO Violated Again]
    D --> E[Continuous Budget Exhaustion]
    E --> F[SLO Becomes Irrelevant]
    
    B -->|Yes| G[Feature Freeze]
    G --> H[Focus on Reliability]
    H --> I[Budget Recovers]
    I --> J[Resume Normal Ops]
    
    style B fill:#f39c12
    style F fill:#e74c3c
    style J fill:#2ecc71
```

**Solution**: 
- Document clear policies
- Automate enforcement where possible
- Hold teams accountable
- Review and update policies regularly

### Anti-Pattern 6: SLO Without Context

**Problem**: Tracking SLO compliance without understanding why violations occur.

**Missing Elements**:
- No link to logs (see [02-logging.md](02-logging.md))
- No trace integration (see [04-tracing.md](04-tracing.md))
- No correlation with deployments
- No incident tracking

**Solution**: Build comprehensive SLO dashboards with diagnostic tools (reference [09-visualization-dashboards.md](09-visualization-dashboards.md)).

### Anti-Pattern 7: Static SLOs

**Problem**: Setting SLOs once and never revising them.

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Services evolve
- User expectations change
- Architecture improvements
- Business priorities shift

**Solution**: Quarterly SLO review process.

## Advanced Topics

### Composite SLOs

**Definition**: SLOs that combine multiple SLIs to represent complex user journeys.

**Example: E-commerce Checkout**:
```
Checkout Success = 
  (Browse Availability × 0.2) +
  (Cart Availability × 0.3) +
  (Payment Availability × 0.4) +
  (Confirmation Availability × 0.1)
```

**Weights** reflect criticality of each step.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Composite SLO:<br/>Checkout Success] --> B[Browse: 99.9%<br/>Weight: 20%]
    A --> C[Add to Cart: 99.95%<br/>Weight: 30%]
    A --> D[Payment: 99.99%<br/>Weight: 40%]
    A --> E[Confirmation: 99.9%<br/>Weight: 10%]
    
    B --> F[Calculate Weighted Average]
    C --> F
    D --> F
    E --> F
    
    F --> G[Overall Score: 99.94%]
    G --> H{Meets 99.9% SLO?}
    H -->|Yes| I[SLO Met]
    H -->|No| J[SLO Violated]
    
    style D fill:#f39c12
    style I fill:#2ecc71
```

### User Journey SLOs

**Concept**: Measure end-to-end user experience across multiple services.

**Example: Video Streaming**:
1. Discover content (search/browse)
2. Select video
3. Video starts playing
4. Playback continues without buffering
5. Quality adapts to network

**SLO**: 95% of viewing sessions complete without significant issues.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Opens App] --> B[Search/Browse]
    B --> C[Select Video]
    C --> D[Video Start]
    D --> E[Playback]
    
    B --> F{Success?}
    C --> F
    D --> F
    E --> F
    
    F -->|All Steps OK| G[Good Session]
    F -->|Any Step Failed| H[Bad Session]
    
    G --> I[Count towards SLI numerator]
    H --> J[Count in denominator only]
    
    style G fill:#2ecc71
    style H fill:#e74c3c
```

### Dependency-Aware SLOs

**Challenge**: Your service depends on external services with their own SLOs.

**Math**:
```
Your Maximum SLO ≤ (Your Availability) × (Dependency 1 SLO) × (Dependency 2 SLO) × ...
```

**Example**:
- Your service: 99.95% internal availability
- Depends on Auth Service: 99.9% SLO
- Depends on Database: 99.95% SLO

Maximum achievable: 99.95% × 99.9% × 99.95% = **99.8%**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Your Service<br/>Target: 99.9%] --> B[Internal Capability:<br/>99.95%]
    A --> C[Dependency 1:<br/>99.9% SLO]
    A --> D[Dependency 2:<br/>99.95% SLO]
    
    B --> E[Combined Maximum]
    C --> E
    D --> E
    
    E --> F[99.95% × 99.9% × 99.95%]
    F --> G[Maximum: 99.8%]
    
    G --> H{Target Achievable?}
    H -->|No - 99.9% > 99.8%| I[Adjust Target or<br/>Improve Dependencies]
    H -->|Yes - 99.9% ≤ 99.8%| J[Target Realistic]
    
    style I fill:#e74c3c
    style J fill:#2ecc71
```

**Strategies for Dependency Management**:

1. **Circuit Breakers**: Fail fast when dependencies unavailable
2. **Caching**: Reduce dependency on real-time availability
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Continue with reduced functionality
4. **Service Credits**: Negotiate dependency SLOs that support your needs

### Multi-Region SLOs

**Complexity**: Different regions have different characteristics.

**Approaches**:

**Option 1: Global Aggregate SLO**
```
Global SLI = (Total Successful Requests Worldwide) / (Total Requests Worldwide)
```

**Pros**: Simple, reflects overall user experience  
**Cons**: Masks regional issues, may hide critical problems

**Option 2: Per-Region SLOs**
```
Each region has independent SLO targets
```

**Pros**: Regional accountability, detailed visibility  
**Cons**: Complex to manage, requires regional teams

**Option 3: Weighted Regional SLOs**
```
Global SLO = Σ(Regional SLI × Traffic Weight)
```

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Global SLO Calculation] --> B[US-East: 99.95%]
    A --> C[US-West: 99.92%]
    A --> D[EU-Central: 99.88%]
    A --> E[Asia-Pacific: 99.90%]
    
    B --> F[Traffic: 40%]
    C --> G[Traffic: 25%]
    D --> H[Traffic: 20%]

    K --> L[Global SLI: 99.92%]
    
    style L fill:#3498db
```

### Customer-Specific SLOs (Multi-Tenancy)

**Challenge**: Different customers have different SLA requirements.

**Tiers**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Customer Tiers] --> B[Enterprise Tier]
    A --> C[Business Tier]
    A --> D[Standard Tier]
    
    B --> B1[SLO: 99.95%]
    B --> B2[Dedicated resources]
    B --> B3[Priority support]
    B --> B4[Individual error budget]
    
    C --> C1[SLO: 99.9%]
    C --> C2[Shared resources]
    C --> C3[Business hours support]
    C --> C4[Pooled error budget]
    
    D --> D1[SLO: 99%]
    D --> D2[Shared resources]
    D --> D3[Community support]
    D --> D4[Best effort]
    
    style B fill:#f39c12
    style C fill:#3498db
    style D fill:#95a5a6
```

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Track SLIs per customer/tenant
- Separate error budgets per tier
- Different alert thresholds
- Resource allocation policies

### Machine Learning for SLO Prediction

**Use Cases**:
1. **Predict SLO Violations**: Alert before SLO is breached
2. **Forecast Error Budget**: Estimate remaining runway
3. **Capacity Planning**: Predict when SLO will become unachievable
4. **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual patterns early

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[ML-Enhanced SLO Monitoring] --> B[Historical Data]
    B --> C[Feature Engineering]
    
    C --> D[Time of day]
    C --> E[Day of week]
    C --> F[Recent trends]
    C --> G[Deployment events]
    C --> H[Traffic patterns]
    
    D --> I[ML Model]
    E --> I
    F --> I
    G --> I
    H --> I
    
    I --> J[Predictions]
    
    J --> K[SLI forecast next 24h]
    J --> L[Error budget exhaustion ETA]
    J --> M[Anomaly likelihood]
    
    K --> N[Proactive Alerting]
    L --> N
    M --> N
    
    style I fill:#9b59b6
    style N fill:#e74c3c
```

**Example Prediction**:
```
Current SLI: 99.91% (meeting 99.9% SLO)
ML Model: "Based on current trends, SLI will drop to 99.87% in 6 hours"
Action: Proactive investigation before SLO violation
```

### Cost-Aware SLOs

**Principle**: Balance reliability against infrastructure costs.

**Analysis**:
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Reliability vs Cost] --> B[99% SLO]
    A --> C[99.9% SLO]
    A --> D[99.99% SLO]
    
    B --> B1[Cost: $10K/month]
    C --> C1[Cost: $25K/month]
    D --> D1[Cost: $100K/month]
    
    B --> B2[Revenue Impact: -$5K]
    C --> C2[Revenue Impact: -$1K]
    D --> D2[Revenue Impact: -$0.1K]
    
    B1 --> E[Calculate ROI]
    B2 --> E
    C1 --> E
    C2 --> E
    D1 --> E
    D2 --> E
    
    E --> F[Optimal: 99.9% SLO]
    
    style F fill:#2ecc71
```

**Formula**:
```
Total Cost = Infrastructure Cost + (Downtime Cost × Failure Rate)
Optimal SLO = Minimize Total Cost
```

### SLO Inheritance and Propagation

**Concept**: Parent service SLO influences child service requirements.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Frontend Service<br/>SLO: 99.9%] --> B[Backend API<br/>Required: 99.95%]
    
    B --> C[Auth Service<br/>Required: 99.97%]
    B --> D[Data Service<br/>Required: 99.97%]
    B --> E[Cache Service<br/>Required: 99.97%]
    
    C --> F[User DB<br/>Required: 99.98%]
    D --> G[Product DB<br/>Required: 99.98%]
    
    style A fill:#e74c3c
    style B fill:#f39c12
    style C fill:#3498db
    style F fill:#2ecc71
```

**Calculation**:
```
Child SLO Requirement = Parent SLO / (# of Dependencies)^(1/2)

Example:
Parent: 99.9%
3 dependencies
Child Required: 99.9% / sqrt(3) ≈ 99.967%
```

## SLO Reporting and Communication

### Executive Reporting

**Key Metrics for Leadership**:

### Postmortem Integration

**SLO Impact Analysis in Postmortems**:

```markdown
## Incident Impact on SLOs

**Affected Services**: Payment Processing API
**Duration**: 45 minutes
**Error Budget Consumed**: 3.2% of monthly budget

### SLO Status Before Incident
- Error Budget Remaining: 67%
- Status: Normal Operations

### SLO Status After Incident
- Error Budget Remaining: 63.8%
- Status: Normal Operations (but closer to caution threshold)

### Error Budget Forecast
- At current burn rate: Budget exhausted in 21 days
- Recommendation: Defer non-critical deployments for 3 days

### Long-term Trends
- 3rd incident this quarter impacting this SLO
- Pattern identified: Database connection pool exhaustion
- Action: Increase connection pool investigation priority
```

## SLO Best Practices

### Start Simple

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[SLO Journey] --> B[Week 1-2:<br/>Choose 1-2 SLIs]
    B --> C[Week 3-4:<br/>Instrument & Measure]
    C --> D[Week 5-8:<br/>Collect Baseline Data]
    D --> E[Week 9-10:<br/>Set Initial SLOs]
    E --> F[Week 11-12:<br/>Create Dashboards]
    F --> G[Month 4+:<br/>Refine & Expand]
    
    style A fill:#3498db
    style G fill:#2ecc71
```

**Don't**:
- Create 20 SLOs on day 1
- Set arbitrary targets without data
- Over-engineer before understanding needs

**Do**:
- Start with availability and latency
- Measure for at least 2 weeks before setting targets
- Iterate based on learning

### Make SLOs Visible

**Transparency Builds Trust**:
- Public dashboards for service status
- Regular SLO reviews in team meetings
- Share postmortem SLO impacts
- Celebrate SLO achievements

### Automate Everything

**Automation Opportunities**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[SLO Automation] --> B[Data Collection]

    E --> E1[CI/CD gates]
    F --> F1[Weekly email summaries]
    
    style A fill:#9b59b6
```

### Document Everything

**SLO Documentation Should Include**:
- Rationale for each SLO
- Measurement methodology
- Historical context
- Error budget policy
- Escalation procedures
- Review schedule

### Foster SLO Culture

**Cultural Elements**:
1. **Shared Ownership**: SLOs are team goals, not individual metrics
2. **Blameless Response**: Focus on system improvement, not blame
3. **Data-Driven Decisions**: Use SLOs to inform trade-offs
4. **Celebrate Success**: Acknowledge when SLOs are met
5. **Learn from Misses**: Treat violations as learning opportunities

```mermaid

## Integration with Other Practices

### SLOs and Feature Development

**Decision Framework**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[New Feature Request] --> B{Check Error Budget}
    
    B -->|Healthy: > 50%| C[Standard Process]
    B -->|Caution: 25-50%| D[Risk Assessment Required]

    I --> K[Feature Backlog]
    K --> L[Wait for Budget Recovery]
    
    style B fill:#3498db
    style E fill:#e74c3c
```

### SLOs and Incident Response

**Incident Severity Based on SLO Impact**:

| Severity | SLO Impact | Response Time | Escalation |
|----------|------------|---------------|------------|
| P0 - Critical | > 5% error budget burn in 1 hour | Immediate | All hands |
| P1 - High | 2-5% error budget burn in 1 hour | 15 minutes | On-call team |
| P2 - Medium | 1-2% error budget burn in 1 hour | 1 hour | Primary on-call |
| P3 - Low | < 1% error budget burn | Next business day | Ticket |

### SLOs and Capacity Planning

**SLO-Driven Capacity Decisions**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Capacity Planning] --> B[Current SLO Performance]
    B --> C{Meeting SLO?}
    
    C -->|Yes, Comfortably| D[Current Capacity Sufficient]
    C -->|Yes, Barely| E[Plan for Growth]
    C -->|No| F[Urgent Capacity Need]
    
    D --> G[Monitor Trends]
    E --> H[Budget for Scaling]
    F --> I[Immediate Investment]
    
    G --> J[Quarterly Review]
    H --> K[Procurement Process]
    I --> L[Emergency Scaling]
    
    style F fill:#e74c3c
    style I fill:#ff9800
```

**Forecasting**:
```
When will current capacity violate SLO?

Given:
- Current traffic growth: 10% per month
- Current SLI at 75% capacity: 99.95%
- SLO target: 99.9%

Forecast: SLO at risk when traffic grows 30% (3 months)
Action: Begin capacity scaling in month 2
```

### SLOs and Change Management

**Change Risk Assessment**:

```mermaid

## Conclusion

Service Level Objectives represent a fundamental shift in how we think about reliability. Rather than pursuing perfect uptime at any cost, SLOs provide a framework for making informed trade-offs between reliability, feature velocity, and operational costs.

### Key Principles Recap

1. **User-Centric**: Measure what users experience, not internal metrics
2. **Realistic**: Perfect reliability is neither achievable nor necessary
3. **Actionable**: Error budgets provide clear decision criteria
4. **Balanced**: Enable both innovation and reliability
