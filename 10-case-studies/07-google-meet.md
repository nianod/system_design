## Core Architecture Components

### 1. Real-Time Communication Architecture

**WebRTC Foundation:**
Google Meet is built on WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) technology, providing peer-to-peer communication capabilities with the following components:

- **ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment)**: NAT traversal and connection establishment
- **STUN/TURN Servers**: Network address discovery and relay services
- **DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security)**: Encryption for data channels
- **SRTP (Secure Real-time Transport Protocol)**: Encrypted media streams

**Signaling Architecture:**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C1 as Client 1
    participant SS as Signaling Server
    participant C2 as Client 2
    participant STUN as STUN Server
    participant TURN as TURN Server

    else P2P Blocked
        C1->>TURN: Relay Request
        TURN->>C2: Relayed Media
        C2->>TURN: Relay Request
        TURN->>C1: Relayed Media
    end
```

### 2. Media Processing Architecture

**Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) Model:**
For multi-party calls, Google Meet uses an SFU architecture rather than a traditional MCU (Multipoint Control Unit):

**SFU Benefits:**
- Lower latency compared to MCU
- Reduced server CPU requirements
- Better quality adaptation per client
- Scalable for large meetings

**Media Flow Architecture:**
```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Participant Devices"
        P1[Participant 1]
        P2[Participant 2]
        P3[Participant 3]
        P4[Participant 4]
    end
    
    subgraph "Google Meet SFU"

        BANDWIDTH_EST[Bandwidth Estimation]
        VIDEO_ROUTER[Video Router]

    AUDIO_MIXER --> P1
    AUDIO_MIXER --> P2
    AUDIO_MIXER --> P3
    AUDIO_MIXER --> P4
```

**Adaptive Bitrate Streaming:**
- **Simulcast**: Clients send multiple video streams at different resolutions/bitrates
- **Dynamic Resolution**: Server selects appropriate stream based on client bandwidth
- **Forward Error Correction (FEC)**: Redundant data for packet loss recovery
- **Congestion Control**: RTCP feedback for bandwidth adaptation

### 3. Global Infrastructure Design

**Edge Node Distribution:**
Google Meet leverages Google's global infrastructure with strategic placement of media processing nodes:

- **Regional Media Centers**: Primary processing hubs in major regions
- **Edge Media Nodes**: Closer to users for reduced latency
- **Anycast Routing**: Automatic routing to nearest available node
- **Load Balancing**: Dynamic distribution based on capacity and latency

**Geographic Distribution Strategy:**
```mermaid
