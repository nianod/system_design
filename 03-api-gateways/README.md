## Overview

An API Gateway serves as a single entry point for all client requests in a microservices architecture. It acts as a reverse proxy that routes requests to appropriate backend services while providing cross-cutting concerns like authentication, rate limiting, monitoring, and request/response transformation.

```mermaid
graph TB
    Client[Client Applications] --> Gateway[API Gateway]
    Gateway --> Auth[Authentication Service]
    Gateway --> Service1[User Service]
    Gateway --> Service2[Order Service]
    Gateway --> Service3[Payment Service]
    Gateway --> Service4[Notification Service]
    
    Gateway --> Cache[(Cache Layer)]
    Gateway --> Monitor[Monitoring & Logging]
```

## System Architecture

The API Gateway implements a layered architecture that provides scalability, security, and maintainability.

- 🔧 [Implementation Patterns](docs/02-patterns.md)

## Quick Start

### Basic Request Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant G as API Gateway
    participant A as Auth Service
    participant S as Backend Service
    participant Cache as Cache Store
    
    C->>G: HTTP Request
    G->>A: Validate Token
    A->>G: Token Valid
    G->>Cache: Check Cache
    Cache-->>G: Cache Miss
    G->>S: Forward Request
    S->>G: Response
    G->>Cache: Store Response
    G->>C: HTTP Response
```

### Configuration Example

```yaml
gateway:
  routes:
    - path: "/api/users/*"
      service: "user-service"
      methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"]
      auth_required: true
      rate_limit: 1000/hour
      
    - path: "/api/orders/*"
      service: "order-service"
      methods: ["GET", "POST"]
      auth_required: true
      cache_ttl: 300
      
  security:
    jwt_secret: "${JWT_SECRET}"
    cors_enabled: true
    
  caching:
    provider: "redis"
    default_ttl: 600
```

## Implementation Patterns

The system supports multiple implementation patterns based on your architectural needs:

### 1. Centralized Gateway Pattern
In this pattern, there is a single API Gateway that serves as the entry point for all clients (web, mobile, IoT, etc.) into your system.

Instead of having multiple gateways (like in BFF), every client talks to one centralized gateway, which then routes requests to the appropriate backend microservices.
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Single API Gateway] --> B[Service 1]
    A --> C[Service 2]
    A --> D[Service 3]
    A --> E[Service N]
```

### 2. Backend for Frontend (BFF) Pattern
Instead of having one generic API that all clients must adapt to, each frontend gets its own "backend service" tailored to its needs.
This backend acts as a facade or gateway, talking to underlying microservices and presenting just the right data in the right shape.
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Web BFF] --> D[Shared Services]
    B[Mobile BFF] --> D
    C[Partner BFF] --> D
    
    D --> E[User Service]
    D --> F[Order Service]
    D --> G[Payment Service]
```

For detailed pattern implementations, see [patterns.md](docs/02-patterns.md).

## Security Considerations

Security is implemented through multiple layers:

- **Authentication**: JWT tokens, OAuth 2.0, API keys
- **Authorization**: Role-based and attribute-based access control
- **Transport Security**: TLS/SSL encryption
- **Input Validation**: Request sanitization and validation
- **Rate Limiting**: DDoS protection and abuse prevention

For comprehensive security guidelines, refer to [security.md](docs/04-security.md).

## Performance & Scaling

### Scaling Strategies

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Horizontal Scaling"
        LB[Load Balancer]
        GW1[Gateway 1]
        GW2[Gateway 2]
        GW3[Gateway 3]
    end
    
    subgraph "Caching Layer"
        Redis[(Redis Cluster)]
        CDN[CDN]
    end
    
    subgraph "Backend Services"
        S1[Service 1]
        S2[Service 2]
        S3[Service 3]
    end
    
    LB --> GW1
    LB --> GW2
    LB --> GW3
    
    GW1 --> Redis
    GW2 --> Redis
    GW3 --> Redis
    
    GW1 --> S1
    GW2 --> S2
    GW3 --> S3
```

Key performance optimizations covered in our documentation:
- Connection pooling and keep-alive strategies ([scaling.md](docs/06-scaling.md))
- Intelligent caching mechanisms ([caching.md](docs/05-caching.md))
- Circuit breaker patterns for fault tolerance ([patterns.md](docs/02-patterns.md))

## Monitoring & Observability

Comprehensive monitoring includes:

- **Metrics**: Request rates, response times, error rates
- **Logging**: Structured logging with correlation IDs
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing across services
- **Health Checks**: Service health and dependency monitoring

```mermaid
graph LR
    Gateway[API Gateway] --> Metrics[Metrics Store]
    Gateway --> Logs[Log Aggregator]
    Gateway --> Traces[Tracing System]
    
    Metrics --> Dashboard[Monitoring Dashboard]
    Logs --> Dashboard
    Traces --> Dashboard
    
    Dashboard --> Alerts[Alert Manager]
```

For implementation details, see [monitoring.md](docs/07-monitoring.md).

## Decision Framework

When considering API Gateway adoption, evaluate:

### ✅ Benefits
- Centralized cross-cutting concerns
- Simplified client integration
- Enhanced security posture
- Improved observability

### ⚠️ Considerations
- Additional network hop latency
- Single point of failure risk
- Increased operational complexity
