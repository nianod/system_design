## Essential Questions (Must Practice)

### Question 1: URL Shortener Service (Like bit.ly)
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐☆☆☆
**Time:** 45 minutes
**Category:** A - CRUD Applications

#### Problem Statement
Design a URL shortening service that allows users to:
- Submit long URLs and receive short URLs
- Click short URLs to redirect to original URLs
- View basic analytics (optional)

#### Expected Architecture
```mermaid
graph TB
    User[User] --> Web[Web Interface]
    Web --> API[REST API Server]
    API --> Cache[Redis Cache\nPopular URLs]
    API --> DB[(PostgreSQL\nURL Mappings)]
    
    subgraph "Database Schema"
        URLs["urls table\n- id: bigint\n- short_code: varchar(10)\n- original_url: text\n- created_at: timestamp\n- click_count: integer"]
    end
    
    DB --> URLs
```

#### Key Discussion Points
1. **Short code generation:** Base62 encoding vs random strings
2. **Database design:** Primary key strategy, indexing
3. **Caching strategy:** Which URLs to cache and when
4. **API design:** POST /shorten, GET /{code} endpoints

#### Evaluation Focus

- Set due dates and priorities

#### Expected Data Model
```mermaid
erDiagram
    USERS {
        bigint id PK
        string email UK
        string password_hash
        string first_name
        string last_name
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp updated_at
    }
    
    LISTS {
        bigint id PK
        bigint user_id FK
        string name
        string description
        string color
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp updated_at
    }
    
    TASKS {
        bigint id PK
        bigint list_id FK
        string title
        text description
        boolean completed
        string priority
        timestamp due_date
        integer position
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp updated_at
    }
    
    USERS ||--o{ LISTS : "owns"
    LISTS ||--o{ TASKS : "contains"
```

#### API Design Example
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Mobile App
    participant API as REST API
    participant DB as Database
    
    App->>API: POST /lists {name: "Work Tasks"}
    API->>DB: INSERT INTO lists
    DB-->>API: list_id: 123
    API-->>App: {id: 123, name: "Work Tasks"}
    
    App->>API: POST /lists/123/tasks {title: "Review PR"}
    API->>DB: INSERT INTO tasks
    DB-->>API: task_id: 456
    API-->>App: {id: 456, title: "Review PR", list_id: 123}
    
    App->>API: PUT /tasks/456 {completed: true}
    API->>DB: UPDATE tasks SET completed = true
    API-->>App: {id: 456, completed: true}
```

#### Key Discussion Points
1. **User authentication:** Session vs JWT tokens
