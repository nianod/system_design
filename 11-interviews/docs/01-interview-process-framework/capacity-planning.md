## SECTION 1: TECHNICAL CAPACITY PLANNING

### Infrastructure Scaling

**Question 1: Web Server Capacity**
> "Design capacity planning for a web application expecting to grow from 10,000 to 1 million daily active users over 12 months."

**Expected Analysis Framework:**
```
Current State:
- 10,000 DAU
- Peak concurrent users: 2,000 (20% of DAU)
- Average session duration: 15 minutes
- Requests per session: 50
- Peak RPS: 2,000 × 50 ÷ (15 × 60) = 111 RPS

Target State (1M DAU):
- 1,000,000 DAU
- Peak concurrent users: 200,000
- Peak RPS: 11,111 RPS (100x increase)
```

**Scaling Strategy:**
- **Vertical scaling limits**: Single server max ~1,000 RPS
- **Horizontal scaling**: Need ~12-15 servers with load balancing
- **Database scaling**: Read replicas, sharding strategy
- **CDN implementation**: Static content delivery
- **Caching layers**: Redis/Memcached for hot data

**Follow-up Questions:**
- How would you handle traffic spikes during peak events?
- What monitoring metrics would you track?
- How would you test this capacity before going live?
- **See [Senior Guide](../03-engineer-interview-guide/senior-guide.md)** for advanced scaling patterns

```
Current: 1,000 QPS (assume 80% reads, 20% writes)
- Read QPS: 800
- Write QPS: 200

Target: 10,000 QPS
- Read QPS: 8,000
- Write QPS: 2,000
```

**Scaling Strategy:**
```
Read Scaling:
- Master + 4-6 read replicas

- Query optimization
- Read caching layer

Write Scaling:
- Vertical scaling of master
- Write-through caching
- Asynchronous processing
- Database sharding (if needed)

Storage Scaling:
