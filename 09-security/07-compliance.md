## Overview

Compliance refers to adhering to laws, regulations, standards, and internal policies that govern how organizations handle data and conduct operations. In system security, compliance ensures that security controls meet legal and industry-specific requirements.

### Why Compliance Matters

- **Legal Protection**: Avoid fines, penalties, and legal action
- **Customer Trust**: Demonstrate commitment to data protection
- **Risk Management**: Identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities
- **Market Access**: Required for certain industries and regions
- **Operational Excellence**: Drives standardization and best practices

### Compliance vs Security

While related, compliance and security serve different purposes:

| Aspect | Compliance | Security |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Focus** | Meeting specific requirements | Protecting against all threats |
| **Scope** | Defined by regulations | Comprehensive threat landscape |
| **Approach** | Checklist-driven | Risk-based |
| **Timeline** | Point-in-time assessments | Continuous monitoring |

**Key Principle**: Compliance is the floor, not the ceiling. Being compliant doesn't guarantee security, but security efforts should support compliance.

## Compliance Implementation Strategy

### 1. Gap Analysis

**Process**:
1. Identify applicable regulations
2. Document current state
3. Map requirements to controls
4. Identify gaps
5. Prioritize remediation

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start Compliance Program] --> B[Identify Regulations]
    B --> C[Conduct Gap Analysis]
    C --> D[Document Current State]
    D --> E[Map Requirements]
    E --> F[Identify Gaps]
    F --> G[Prioritize Remediation]
    G --> H[Create Remediation Plan]
    H --> I[Implement Controls]
    I --> J[Validate Controls]
    J --> K[Continuous Monitoring]
    K --> C
```

### 2. Control Mapping

Map compliance requirements to technical and organizational controls:

| Requirement | Control Type | Implementation | Reference |
|------------|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| Encrypt data at rest | Technical | AES-256 encryption | [encryption.md](03-encryption.md) |
| Multi-factor authentication | Technical | MFA for all admin access | [authentication.md](01-authentication.md) |
| Access control | Technical | RBAC implementation | [authorization.md](02-authorization.md) |
| Audit logging | Technical | Centralized logging | [monitoring_auditing.md](08-monitoring_auditing.md) |
| Security awareness | Organizational | Annual training | [best_practises.md](09-best_practises.md) |

### 3. Compliance Architecture

Design systems with compliance in mind:

**Principles**:
- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary access (see [authorization.md](02-authorization.md))
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security (see [network_security.md](04-network_security.md))
- **Separation of Duties**: No single person has complete control
- **Audit Trail**: Log all activities (see [monitoring_auditing.md](08-monitoring_auditing.md))
- **Data Classification**: Identify and protect sensitive data (see [data_security.md](06-data_security.md))

### 4. Vendor Management
