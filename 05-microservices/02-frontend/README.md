## 🎯 Key Benefits

- **Independent Development**: Teams can work autonomously on different parts
- **Technology Diversity**: Mix and match frameworks as needed
- **Scalable Teams**: Easy to scale development teams and assign ownership
- **Incremental Upgrades**: Update parts without affecting the whole application
- **Fault Isolation**: Failures in one service don't crash the entire app

## 📊 When to Use Micro Frontends

### ✅ Good Fit
- Large applications with multiple teams
- Different parts have different technical requirements
- Need for independent deployments
- Legacy system modernization
- Organizational scaling challenges

### ❌ Not Recommended
- Small teams or simple applications
- Tight coupling between features
- Limited development resources
- Performance-critical applications with strict budgets
